# STAT305_BioStatistics_Project
The dataset provided for this group project provides information on the performance of students. The data attributes include demographic, social and school related attributes which were collected using school reports and questionnaires. Interest is on factors that contributed to a student passing (as per their final grade). For this project we performed an appropriate two-way test of association for each of the relevant categorical explanatory variables and the response of interest. Clearly stated the hypotheses and conclusions on the project report. We then fitted a statisical model and later looked for the best fitting model and interpreted the results.
